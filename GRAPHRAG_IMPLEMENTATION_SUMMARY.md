# GraphRAG Implementation Summary

## Key Discovery
The reference GraphRAG implementation at `/Users/a.evseev/dev/RAG/lightrag-graphrag-neo4j/data/mixed/` achieves near-100% accuracy by using **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) graphs with chunk-to-chunk SIMILAR relationships**, not entity extraction. This is the true GraphRAG approach.

## What We Built

### 1. KNN Graph System (`src/core/knn_graph.py`)
- Creates SIMILAR relationships between chunks based on embedding similarity
- Uses cosine similarity with configurable thresholds (0.5 minimum)
- Builds bidirectional relationships for graph traversal
- Average 2.1 neighbors per chunk with 116 total relationships

### 2. Modified Chunking Strategy (`ingest_anton.py`)
- Reduced chunk size from 1000 to 450 characters
- 100 character overlap for context continuity
- 27 chunks total for Anton's document
- Each chunk stored with OpenAI embeddings

### 3. Three Search Modes (`src/rag_system.py`)

#### Vector Mode (Traditional RAG)
- Direct cosine similarity search in Neo4j
- Returns top-k most similar chunks
- **Performance: 93.25% accuracy**

#### Graph Mode (True GraphRAG)
- Starts with top 7 vector search results
- Traverses SIMILAR relationships from top 5 chunks
- Expands context through graph connections
- **Performance: 54.10% accuracy** (needs tuning)

#### Hybrid Mode
- Combines vector (60% weight) and graph (40% weight) results
- Merges and re-ranks based on weighted scores
- **Performance: 79.33% accuracy**

## Results Comparison

### Before Implementation (Entity-based approach):
- Vector: 98% accuracy
- Graph: 79-86% accuracy

### After Implementation (KNN Graph approach):
- Vector: 93.25% accuracy
- Graph: 54.10% accuracy (degraded due to over-traversal)
- Hybrid: 79.33% accuracy

## Key Learnings

1. **True GraphRAG uses chunk similarity graphs**, not entity extraction
2. **Chunk size matters**: 400-500 chars optimal for graph traversal
3. **Graph traversal needs careful tuning** to avoid retrieving irrelevant chunks
4. **Metadata chunks can dominate** vector search and need special handling

## Current Issues

1. **Graph mode performance**: Retrieving too many irrelevant chunks
2. **Missing information**: Some chunks not being retrieved properly
3. **Traversal parameters**: Need optimization for min_score and limits

## Configuration

### Neo4j Settings
```python
neo4j_uri: "bolt://localhost:7687"
neo4j_username: "neo4j"
neo4j_password: "password"
```

### KNN Graph Parameters
```python
min_similarity: 0.5  # Threshold for creating SIMILAR relationships
max_neighbors: 10    # Maximum neighbors per chunk
batch_size: 50       # Batch size for processing
```

### Search Parameters
```python
# Vector search
top_k: 10
similarity_threshold: 0.2

# Graph traversal
initial_chunks: 7
traverse_from_top: 5
traversal_limit: 7
min_traversal_score: 0.5
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/core/knn_graph.py` - KNN graph builder
- `test_anton_graphrag.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `debug_similarity.py` - Similarity analysis tool

### Modified Files
- `ingest_anton.py` - Added KNN graph building
- `src/rag_system.py` - Added graph and hybrid search modes

## Next Steps for Optimization

1. **Tune graph traversal parameters**:
   - Reduce number of traversed chunks
   - Increase similarity threshold for traversal
   - Implement depth-limited traversal

2. **Improve chunk selection**:
   - Better initial chunk selection strategy
   - Weighted traversal based on query relevance
   - Prune low-relevance paths

3. **Optimize hybrid mode**:
   - Dynamic weight adjustment
   - Query-dependent mode selection
   - Result deduplication

## Conclusion

We successfully implemented the true GraphRAG approach using KNN graphs, matching the architecture of the reference implementation. While vector mode performs well at 93.25%, the graph mode needs further tuning to achieve the expected near-100% accuracy. The key insight is that GraphRAG is about chunk-to-chunk similarity relationships, not entity extraction.
